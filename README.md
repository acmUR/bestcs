## Philosophy

1. **_Trust by default._ just contribute!**
2. **_Maintain history._**
  - Why? Over time we accumulate a lot of knowledge and resources. We shouldn't lose it.
3. **_Share ownership._**
  - Don't put things in your personal workspace, you won't be around forever!
4. **_Every little helps._**
  - Found a page that explained something really well? Add it here, and others will benefit too!
